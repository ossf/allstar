// Package policydef defines the interface that policies must implement to be
// included in Allstar.
//
// Policies should define and retrieve their own config in the same way that
// Allstar does. There should be an org-level config and repo-level
// config. Each config should include the OptConfig defined in
// github.com/ossf/allstar/pkg/config to determine if the policy is enabled or
// disabled. The config package also provided helper functions to retrieve
// config from the repo.

	// return.
