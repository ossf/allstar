# Contributor Ladder

***Allstar follows the [OpenSSF Scorecard contributor ladder](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/CONTRIBUTOR_LADDER.md).***

Contributors to Allstar are documented in [MAINTAINERS.md](/MAINTAINERS.md).

## Changes

This section briefly details key differences between the OpenSSF Scorecard contributor ladder and the legacy Allstar contributor ladder.

- *Active* legacy "Contributors" who are not OpenSSF GitHub organization members are now ["Community Members"](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/CONTRIBUTOR_LADDER.md#community-members)
  - Community Members are eligible for [OpenSSF GitHub organization](https://github.com/ossf) membership. Outside collaborator access [***should never be granted***](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/policies/access.md#teams-not-individuals).
- Existing OpenSSF GitHub organization members who are actively reviewing content can be granted [Triagers access](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/CONTRIBUTOR_LADDER.md#triagers)
- Legacy "Maintainers" and "Leaders" are now considered equivalent [access levels][maintainers-access]
- Existing OpenSSF Scorecard maintainers may be granted [Maintainer access][maintainers-access], based on need

[maintainers-access]: https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/CONTRIBUTOR_LADDER.md#maintainers
