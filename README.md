# **Allstar**

Allstar is a GitHub App installed on organizations or repositories to set and
enforce security policies. Its goal is to be able to continuously monitor and
detect any GitHub setting or repository file contents that may be risky or do
not follow security best practices. If Allstar finds a repository to be out of
compliance, it will take an action such as create an issue or restore security
settings.

The specific policies are intended to be highly configurable, to try to meet the
needs of different project communities and organizations. Also, developing and
contributing new policies is intended to be easy.

Allstar is developed under the [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/) organization, as
a part of the [Securing Critical Projects Working
Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-securing-critical-projects). The OpenSSF runs
[an instance of Allstar here](https://github.com/apps/allstar-app) for anyone to
install and use on their GitHub organizations. However, Allstar can be run by
anyone if need be, see [the operator docs](operator.md) for more details.

## **Quick start**

[Install Allstar GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/allstar-app) on your
organizations and repositories. When installing Allstar, you may review the
permissions requested. Allstar asks for read access to most settings and file
contents to detect security compliance. It requests write access to issues to
create issues, and to checks to allow the `block` action.

Follow the [quick start instructions](quick-start.md) to setup the configuration
files needed to enable Allstar on your repositories. For more details on
advanced configuration, see below.

### [Help! I'm getting issues created by Allstar and I don't want them.](opt-out.md)

## **Enable Configuration**

Allstar can be enabled on individual repositories at the app level, with
the option of enabling or disabling each security policy individually. For
organization-level configuration, create a repository named `.allstar` in your
organization. Then create a file called `allstar.yaml` in that
repository.

Allstar can either be set to an opt-in or opt-out strategy. In opt-in, only
those repositories explicitly listed are enabled. In opt-out, all repositories
are enabled, and repositories would need to be explicitly added to
opt-out. Allstar is set to opt-in by default, and therefore is not enabled on
any repository immediately after installation. To continue with the default
opt-in strategy, list the repositories for Allstar to be enabled on in your
organization like so:

```
optConfig:
  optInRepos:
  - repo-one
  - repo-two
```

To switch to the opt-out strategy (recommended), set that option to true:

```
optConfig:
  optOutStrategy: true
```

If you wish to enable Allstar on all but a few repositories, you may use opt-out
and list the repositories to disable:

```
optConfig:
  optOutStrategy: true
  optOutRepos:
  - repo-one
  - repo-two
```

To opt-out all private/public repositories, add `optOutPrivateRepos` or `optOutPublicRepos`. ex:

```
optConfig:
  optOutStrategy: true
  optOutPrivateRepos: true
  optOutPublicRepos: false
```

### Secondary Org-Level configuration location

By default, org-level configuration files, such as the `allstar.yaml` file
above, are expected to be in a `.allstar` repository. If this repository does
not exist, then the `.github` repository `allstar` directory is used as a
secondary location. To clarify, for `allstar.yaml`:

| Prescedence | Repository | Path |
| - | - | - |
| Primary | `.allstar` | `allstar.yaml` |
| Secondary | `.github` | `allstar/allstar.yaml` |

This is also true for the org-level configuration files for the individual
policies, as described below.

### Repository Override

Individual repositories can also opt in or out using configuration files inside
those repositories. For example, if the organization is configured with the
opt-out strategy, a repository may opt itself out by including the file
`.allstar/allstar.yaml` with the contents:

```
optConfig:
  optOut: true
```

Conversely, this allows repositories to opt-in and enable Allstar when the
organization is configured with the opt-in strategy. Because opt-in is the
default strategy, this is how Allstar works if the `.allstar` repository doesn't
exist.

At the organization-level `allstar.yaml`, repository override may be disabled
with the setting:

```
optConfig:
  disableRepoOverride: true
```

This allows an organization-owner to have a central point of approval for
repositories to request an opt-out through a GitHub PR. Understandably, Allstar
or individual policies may not make sense for all repositories.

### Policy Enable

Each individual policy configuration file (see below) also contains the exact
same `optConfig` configuration object. This allows granularity to enable
policies on individual repositories. A policy will not take action unless
it is enabled **and** Allstar is enabled as a whole.

### Definition

- [Organization level enable configuration](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ossf/allstar@v0.0.0-20210728182754-005854d69ba7/pkg/config#OrgOptConfig)
- [Repository Override enable configuration]( https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ossf/allstar@v0.0.0-20210728182754-005854d69ba7/pkg/config#RepoOptConfig)

## **Actions**

Each policy can be configured with an action that Allstar will take when it
detects a repository to be out of compliance.

- `log`: This is the default action, and actually takes place for all
  actions. All policy run results and details are logged. Logs are currently
  only visible to the app operator, plans to expose these are under discussion.
- `issue`: This action creates a GitHub issue. Only one issue is created per
  policy, and the text describes the details of the policy violation. If the
  issue is already open, it is pinged with a comment every 24 hours (not
  currently user configurable). Once the violation is addressed, the issue will
  be automatically closed by Allstar within 5-10 minutes.
- `fix`: This action is policy specific. The policy will make the changes to the
  GitHub settings to correct the policy violation. Not all policies will be able
  to support this (see below).

Proposed, but not yet implemented actions. Definitions will be added in the
future.

- `block`: Allstar can set a [GitHub Status
  Check](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks)
  and block any PR in the repository from being merged if the check fails.
- `email`: Allstar would send an email to the repository administrator(s).
- `rpc`: Allstar would send an rpc to some organization-specific system.

### **Action configuration**

Two settings are available to configure the issue action:

- `issueLabel` is available at the organization and repository level. Setting it
  will override the default `allstar` label used by Allstar to identify its
  issues.

- `issueRepo` is available at the orgainaztion level. Setting it will force all
  issues created in the organization to be created in the repo specfied.

## **Policies**

Similar to the Allstar app enable configuration, all policies are enabled and
configured with a yaml file in either the organization's `.allstar` repository,
or the repository's `.allstar` directory. As with the app, policies are opt-in
by default, also the default `log` action won't produce visible results. A
simple way to enable all policies is to create a yaml file for each policy with
the contents:

```
optConfig:
  optOutStrategy: true
action: issue
```

The `fix` action is not implemented in any policy yet, but will be implemented
in those policies where it is applicable soon.

### Branch Protection

This policy's config file is named `branch_protection.yaml`, and the [config
definitions are
here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ossf/allstar@v0.0.0-20210728182754-005854d69ba7/pkg/policies/branch#OrgConfig).

The branch protection policy checks that GitHub's [branch protection
settings](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches)
are setup correctly according to the specified configuration. The issue text
will describe which setting is incorrect. See [GitHub's
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches)
for correcting settings.

### Binary Artifacts

This policy's config file is named `binary_artifacts.yaml`, and the [config
definitions are
here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ossf/allstar@v0.0.0-20210728182754-005854d69ba7/pkg/policies/binary#OrgConfig).

This policy incorporates the [check from
scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/#scorecard-checks). Remove the
binary artifact from the repository to achieve compliance. As the scorecard
results can be verbose, you may need to run [scorecard
itself](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) to see all the detailed information.

### Outside Collaborators

This policy's config file is named `outside.yaml`, and the [config definitions
are
here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ossf/allstar@v0.0.0-20210728182754-005854d69ba7/pkg/policies/outside#OrgConfig).

This policy checks if any [Outside
Collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/adding-outside-collaborators-to-repositories-in-your-organization)
have either administrator(default) or push(optional) access to the
repository. Only organization members should have this access, as otherwise
untrusted members can change admin level settings and commit malicious code.

### SECURITY.md

This policy's config file is named `security.yaml`, and the [config definitions
are
here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ossf/allstar@v0.0.0-20210728182754-005854d69ba7/pkg/policies/security#OrgConfig).

This policy checks that the repository has a security policy file in
`SECURITY.md` and that it is not empty. The created issue will have a link to
the [GitHub
tab](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository)
that helps you commit a security policy to your repository.

### Future Policies

- Ensure dependabot is enabled.
- Check that dependencies are pinned/frozen.
- More [checks from scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/#scorecard-checks).

## **Example Config Repository**

See [this repo](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/.allstar) as an example
of Allstar config being used. As the organization administrator, consider a
README.md with some information on how Allstar is being used in your
organization.

## **Contribute Policies**

[Interface definition.](pkg/policydef/policydef.go)

Both the [SECURITY.md](pkg/policies/security/security.go) and [Outside
Collaborators](pkg/policies/outside/outside.go) policies are quite simple to
understand and good examples to copy.
